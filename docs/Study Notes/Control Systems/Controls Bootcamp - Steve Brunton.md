# Controls Bootcamp - Steve Brunton

## Overview

- Controls are of two types:
    - Passive Control: Control introduced in system due to design. Does not need additional energy to function. e.g. Truck shape introducing drag to keep it from lifting
    - Active Control: Control introduced in system by use of external energy. Types:
        - Open Loop: No feedback in system which results in continuous inputs.
        - Closed Loop: Introduces feedback system using sensors which can be used for minute control which varies based on output of the system.

- Why Feedback is needed?
    - **Uncertainity**: System often has uncertainity which renders preplanned input useless.
    - **Instability**: System might be unstable due to external noise. Feedback can result in better control.
    - **Disturbance** tends to pass through system dynamics and can be measured to improve control over it.
    - **Efficient:** Introducing feedback results in overall lower energy consumption due to applied force being proportional to present error, thus reduces overall lower energy.
