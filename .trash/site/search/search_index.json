A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a deeper dive into Docker and its advantages:</p> <ol> <li>What is Docker?<ul> <li>Containerization: Docker allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a single unit called a container. This container can be moved across different stages of development or different environments (like dev, staging, and production) ensuring consistency.</li> <li>Images and Containers: In Docker, an \u201cimage\u201d is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software. A \u201ccontainer\u201d is a running instance of an image.</li> <li>Docker Engine: This is the heart of Docker. It\u2019s responsible for creating, running, and managing containers.</li> <li>Docker Hub: A cloud-based registry where Docker users and partners can create, test, store, and distribute container images.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Why Use Docker?<ul> <li>Consistency: One of the most significant benefits of Docker is its ability to provide consistent environments. Developers can define the environment in which an application runs, which eliminates the \u201cit works on my machine\u201d problem.</li> <li>Isolation: Containers run in isolation, ensuring that they don\u2019t interfere with each other or with the host system. This makes it easier to manage dependencies and resources.</li> <li>Portability: Since containers encapsulate all the dependencies an application needs to run, they can be moved seamlessly across different stages of development or different environments.</li> <li>Efficiency: Containers are lightweight compared to traditional virtual machines because they share the host system\u2019s OS kernel, rather than needing their operating system.</li> <li>Version Control for Environments: Docker images can be versioned, allowing teams to track changes, roll back, and share versions among team members.</li> <li>Rapid Deployment: Containers can be started in seconds, making scaling, deploying, and rollback faster and more efficient.</li> <li>Integration and CI/CD: Docker fits well into continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows. Changes can be packed into containers and tested as they progress through the pipeline, ensuring that each stage is tested in an environment that\u2019s identical to production.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Common Use Cases:<ul> <li>Microservices: Breaking down applications into smaller services that run in their containers.</li> <li>Development Environments: Ensuring that every developer works in a consistent environment.</li> <li>Testing: Quickly creating disposable instances of an application to run tests.</li> <li>Scaling &amp; Load Balancing: Easily scaling out applications by running multiple containers across multiple host machines.</li> <li>Rapid Deployment: Quickly rolling out features, patches, or updates.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, Docker offers a solution to the problem of \u201chow to get software to run reliably when moved from one computing environment to another.\u201d This could be from a developer\u2019s local machine to a test environment, from a staging environment into production, or a physical machine in a data centre to a virtual machine in a private or public cloud.</p>"},{"location":"Study%20Notes/Docker/Basics/#basics","title":"Basics","text":""},{"location":"Study%20Notes/Docker/Basics/#installing-docker","title":"Installing Docker","text":"<p>Install docker in Ubuntu from a terminal using</p> <pre><code>sudo apt-get install docker.io\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Study%20Notes/Docker/Basics/#common-helping-commands","title":"Common Helping Commands","text":"<ul> <li>List Docker Containers: <code>docker ps</code><ul> <li>Add <code>a</code> flag for stopped containers</li> </ul> </li> <li>List Images: <code>docker images</code></li> <li>Delete Docker Image: <code>docker rmi &lt;image-name&gt;</code></li> <li>Delete Docker Containers: <code>docker container &lt;container-name/container-id&gt;</code></li> <li>Docker Resource Utilization: <code>docker stats</code></li> </ul>"},{"location":"Study%20Notes/Docker/Basics/#pulling-an-image-from-dockerhub","title":"Pulling an Image from DockerHub","text":"<p>Syntax: <code>docker pull &lt;image-name:version&gt;</code></p> <p>If you don\u2019t mention version, the latest one is pulled.

Each container is connected to this bridge network by default. Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other using IP addresses and they can be accessed from the host machine as well. This network provides isolation and basic networking functionality.</li> <li>Host Network: Containers can share the network namespace with the host machine, allowing them to use the host\u2019s network stack directly. This option can provide better network performance but may compromise isolation to some extent.</li> <li>Overlay Network: Docker supports overlay networks, which are used for connecting containers running on different Docker hosts. This is particularly useful in distributed and clustered setups, such as when managing containers using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.</li> <li>Macvlan Network: Macvlan allows containers to have their own MAC addresses, making them appear as separate physical devices on the network. This can be useful for scenarios where containers need to be directly accessible on the local network.</li> <li>Custom Bridge Network: Users can create their own custom bridge networks with specific configurations, allowing more control over container communication and connectivity.</li> <li>None Network: Containers can also be launched without network access, which can be useful for certain isolation scenarios.</li> <li>Port Mapping: Docker provides port mapping (port forwarding) to allow containers to expose and receive traffic on specific ports. This is essential for accessing containerized services from the host or external networks.</li> </ol> <p>Docker networking is a crucial aspect of containerization because it allows developers to build and deploy applications in isolated environments while ensuring they can communicate with each other and the outside world.
